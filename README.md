A short introduction to Python, NumPy, and Pandas
=================================================

This repository collects slides, exercises and other supporting material used in
the Python language introduction delivered at [BrainHack Zurich][1] on March 2, 2017.

[1]: https://dynage.github.io/brainhack-zh/

The material in this course covers:

* the basics of Python programming, up to the point of being able to do simple loops, file I/O, and basic data structure manipulation (part 01);
* basics of NumPy and plotting with Matplotlib/Seaborn (part 02);
* table manipulation with Pandas (part 03).

The three parts are meant to be independent; those who already know Python
programming may want to skip part 1 altogether.

Basic computer programming knowledge (e.g., what is a variable, what is a loop)
is assumed and not covered in the material: students should already be familiar
with scripting languages (e.g. bash, perl) and have already written some
computer programs.

How to use the material
-----------------------

The IPython notebooks in files `*EMPTY.ipynb` contain exercises to be solved
during the course. A copy of the notebooks with complete solutions, is available
in the `solutions/` subdirectory. A PDF slide deck introduces and completements
the first exercise notebook; for parts 2 and 3, commentary and links are
directly embedded in the notebook and there is no separate slide deck.
